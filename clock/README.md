Description:

- CSS - clock face and hands
- Javascript: Numbers created and placed
- JavaScript: Clock hands positioned every second in realtime
- JavaScript: Hour hand placed in real position between hours
- HTML data attribute allows us to define the click numbers to show all the numbers or just 3,6,9,12

Notes:
Changes made to original source:

- separate large function into smaller functions
- move hour hand to position between numbers to reflect actual minutes
- place numbers around the clock face via JavaScript:
  : data-show="all" = show all numbers
  : data-show="simple" - show only 3,6,9,12
