# HTML + CSS + JavaScript clock

## Description:

- CSS - clock face and hands
- Javascript: Numbers created and placed
- JavaScript: Clock hands positioned every second in realtime
- JavaScript: Hour hand placed in real position between hours
- HTML data attribute allows us to define the click numbers to show all the numbers or just 3,6,9,12

## Additions:

- Separate large function into smaller functions
- Move hour hand to position between numbers to reflect actual minutes
- Place numbers around the clock face via JavaScript:
  : data-show="all" = show all numbers
  : data-show="simple" - show only 3,6,9,12

## Wish List

- [ ] Add option to show no numbers and/or show simple bars rather than numbers
- [ ] Get time from a remote source (api) rather than system clock
- [ ] Show world clock
